In this game, the player will be dealt two random cards from a deck of 52 cards. The player will be able to either hit
or stand depending on the value of the cards. The player will be able to hit as many times as they want until they either
stand or bust. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If the player goes over 21,
they bust and the dealer wins. If the player stands, the dealer will hit until they either beat the player or bust all
while having a soft cap of 17. The player will win if they have a higher value than the dealer without going over 21.
If the player and dealer have the same value, the game will be a a tie and no winner is declared.

The suits of the cards do not matter in this game. The value of the cards are as follows:
2-10: Face value
J,K, and Q are worth 10
Aces are worth 1 or 11 depending if the player hits or stands

Patterns being used:
- Singleton for a single instance of the deck of cards
- Observer is used to show the cards that the player and dealer have and their score. It also shows the winner of the game
- Command patterns for the player to hit or stand
